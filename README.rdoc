== README

I am using Ruby version 2 for this

To start do: 

rake db:create:all
rake db:migrate

rake db:load_zipcodes (Note: this will take SOME TIME!)
rake db:load_aca (Note: this will take SOME TIME!)

rails s

The data directory is excluded on Heroku, so use the toolbelt to push
up the db instead of trying to run the rake tasks remotely.
